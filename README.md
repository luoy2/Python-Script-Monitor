# Python-Script-Monitor
a simple qtgui application

## Why Am I creating this repo?
people love python. we use python running a lot of process at backend. For e.g., one may have a script running 24/7 scrapping stock tick price from yahoo.com, or one may have a python script send report everyday. Windows Task Schedule works great for it, however, we never know if a script is failed or not. Thats why I decide to build this gui monitor system and hopefully it can help me keep in track all my python script is successfully runing or not.
